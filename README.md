# Few Good Js Challenges
A few good JavaScript problems for pratice. See the associated folders in this repo for solutions. 

#Problems
##\#1
Write a JavaScript function which accepts an array of numbers and returns the sum of the array.

##\#2
Write a JavaScript function which accepts a number and returns True if the number is a prime number and False if the number is not a prime number.

##\#3
Given the following array as an input array = [{ num: [1, 1, 100] , type: 'sum' }, { num: [1, 32, 100, 12, 3, 1, 0, -12] , type: 'multiply' }] or a similar array with similar elements in it, write a JavaScript function which will return the resultant total of the array. For example in the array above your function must take the sum of 1,1,100 and it must multiply 1,32,100,12,3,1,0 and then return the sumation of these two sub totals. Create this function with out using any type of loop.
